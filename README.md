Simple Webpack Starterkit
=========================

Minimal, just-for-learning-stuff oriented webpack starter kit. Mainly based on the precious information found on the official "Getting Started" guide and Webpack documentation. 

What is (expected to be) done here:

- manage some JS files 
- manage SASS
- extract and store built CSS file apart 
- distinct builds for development and production

## Usage 
In the `_preprocess` folder:

```
$ npm install 
```

then:

```
$ npm run build 
```

for "production" build, or:

```
$ npm start
```

for development, with watcher.
